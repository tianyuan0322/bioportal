C0018995|A0066958|AT13936455||AIR|WHAT: Hemochromatosis: Hemochromatosis: a disorder of iron metabolism characterized by excess deposition of iron in the tissues, especially the liver. It is characterized by pigmentation of the skin, hepatic cirrhosis, decreased carbohydrate tolerance, cardiomyopathy and endocrinopathy (especially hypogonadism). Mainly seen in men over the age of 40 years. It has an associated arthropathy distinguished by involvement of the metacarpophalangeal joints (particularly the second and third), wrists, knees, shoulders, and hips. There is often an associated chondrocalcinosis.	WHY:	Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease that produces an arthritis similar to osteoarthritis or pseudogout.	HOW:	Hemochromatosis is diagnosed by the typical physical and radiographic findings supported by elevated serum iron concentrations and high transferrin saturations. Serum ferritin is also markedly elevated. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be done by demonstrating hepatic iron deposition on liver biopsy.|N||

Hyperparathyroidism: a condition due to an increase in the secretion of the parathyroids, causing generalized osteitis fibrosa cystica, elevated serum calcium, decreased serum phosphorus, and increased excretion of both calcium and phosphorus.	WHY:	Several rheumatological disorders are associated with hyperpara- thyroidism. First, hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis (which may mimic hyperparathyroidism with renal stone formation and colic) have an increased incidence in patients with hyperparathyroidism. Second, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism show an increased incidence of chondrocalcinosis with episodes of calcium pyrophosphate crystal induced synovitis. Approximately 25% of patients with hyperparathyroidism will show radiographic evidence of calcification of articular cartilage and joint capsules. Finally, there can be a synovial and cartilaginous lesion ("osteogenic synovitis") in patients with hyperparathyroidism which may mimic other primary rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In osteogenic synovitis there is softening and collapse of subchondral bone. Eventually the cartilage overlying this area erodes and is replaced by an irregular fibrocartilage. Eventually the articular surface of the joint is destroyed and secondary degenerative arthritis may develop.

Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS): an eye condition in which there is decreased tear production and inflammation of the cornea and conjunctiva.	WHY:	Keratoconjunctivitis sicca is found in a significant number of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. KCS has also been described in systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, and scleroderma. KCS plus xerostomia is called the sicca syndrome. The association of the sicca syndrome with rheumatoid arthritis is known as Sjogren's syndrome.	HOW:	Clinically, patients with KCS may present with itching, burning eyes. They may complain of a dry sensation or of a foreign body sensation of the eyes. The conjunctiva is hyperemic, and thick strands of mucus may cover the eye. With slit lamp examination there is less than 1 mm of tear width at the margins of the upper and lower lids. There is increased debris and mucus strands within the tear film, seen best after blinking. Tiny punctate opacities are seen throughout the corneal surface. The Schirmer tear test (which is most accurately performed without topical anesthesia) shows less than 5 mm of wetting of filter paper at the end of 5 minutes. Finally, rose bengal, which is a water soluble dye specific for devitalized cells and mucin, will stain the dessicated corneal and conjunctival cells a bright red color.

Ochronosis: the pathologic accumulation of a blue-black pigment in the connective tissues of persons with alkaptonuria, a rare inborn error of metabolism. These persons lack the enzyme homogentisic acid oxidase, resulting in a buildup of homogentisic acid, a precursor of the pigment.	WHY:	The great majority of patients with ochronosis eventually develop an arthropathy clinically resembling degenerative joint disease.	HOW:	Ochronosis is diagnosed by the combination of pigmentation of the cartilage, the presence of homogentisic acid in the urine, and arthritis usually involving the knees, hips, lumbosacral spine, and shoulders. The slate blue-black pigmentation is most apparent in the sclera of the eyes, the external ears, and the tympanic membranes. The cerumen may also show a dark discoloration. The presence of homogentisic acid in the urine is determined by the dark color which occurs when the urine is alkalinized and by paper chromatography.

Both may be marked by illusions, hallucinations, delusions, or disturbances of perceptions, mood, behavior, cognitive capacity, or personality.	WHY:	Delirium can occur with rheumatic fever or cerebral vasculitis. Both delirium and dementia can occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, and rarely also in mixed connective tissue disease.

Psychosis: a loss of contact with reality, a thought disorder, or a change of personality or behavior often associated with delusions, illusions, or hallucinations.	WHY:	Psychosis may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, or with the administration of steroids, cimetadine (Tagemet), or reserpine.	HOW:	A psychosis probably exists if a patient demonstrates one or more of the following major criteria: MAJOR CRITERIA LOSS OF CONTACT WITH REALITY -- evidenced by the misinterpretation of the environment as hostile when friendly or vice versa, generally causing bizarre responses to normal and usual environmental stimuli. THOUGHT DISTURBANCE -- evidenced by incoherence, marked illogical content, marked loose associations, or patient's admission of mental confusion and abnormal rate of mental activity. PERSONALITY/BEHAVIOR CHANGES -- characterized by rapid onset and reversals of previous behavior patterns, often observed by reliable family member or friend. The diagnosis is further strengthened by the presence of one or more of the following minor criteria: MINOR CRITERIA DELUSIONS -- firmly held beliefs that cannot be dissuaded by logical discussion; generally of a threatening, powerful, or grandiose nature. ILLUSIONS -- misperceptions of environmental stimuli, e.g. perceiving a person instead of an actual tree shadow. HALLUCINATIONS -- perceptions without environmental stimuli, e.g. hearing voices/noises or seeing a face/vision.	REFS:	1) "Differential Diagnosis of Psychotic Features".

C0034735|A0246569|AT13936348||AIR|WHAT: Raynaud's phenomenon.	Raynaud's Phenomenon: the paroxysmal constriction of the small arteries and arterioles of the hands or feet, usually precipitated by cold or emotional upset, resulting in pallor and cyanosis of the fingers or toes following a characteristic pattern.	WHY:	Raynaud's phenomenon may occur in mixed connective tissue disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive systemic sclerosis, poly- myositis/dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis associated with Sjogren's syndrome.	HOW:	In Raynaud's phenomenon there are three classic color changes of the fingers or toes. First, vasoconstriction results in a white blanching of the fingertips. Second, vasodilatation with sludging of vascular flow follows and results in blue, cyanotic digits. Finally, with recovery, there is increased blood flow with resulting erythema of the fingers. With observation of two of the three color changes, Raynaud's phenomenon is considered present. Local body cooling (by placing the hands in ice cold water) may demonstrate Raynaud's phenomenon, but some cases require general body cooling before the characteristic color phases occur. Permanent tissue damage can be induced by this testing, which therefore must be done only when absolutely necessary. If the digits show persistent cyanosis or there is evidence of pre-existing necrosis, performing this test is especially hazardous. One or more digits may be involved in Raynaud's phenomenon, and this involvement may be unilateral.	REFS:	1) Spittell, JA: "Raynaud's phenomenon and allied vasospastic disorders".

It has a special predilection for the lung and lymph tissues.	WHY:	Sarcoidosis can result in an acute arthritis commonly affecting the ankles and knees and less commonly the proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, and elbows.

C0036572|A0115074|AT13936426||AIR|WHAT: Seizure.	Seizure: a paroxysmal transient disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena, psychic or sensory disturbance or perturbation of the autonomic brain electrical activity.	WHY:	Seizures may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus or in necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis, eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis, aortic arch arteritis, or rheumatoid arteritis.	HOW:	A seizure probably exists when there are generalized convulsions or focal motor/sensory phenomenon. GENERALIZED CONVULSIONS may be preceded by an aura but usually have a sudden loss of consciousness with generalized muscle rigidity then generalized muscle activity. They may have incontinence of urine or feces or laceration of the tongue or buccal mucosa. This usually is followed by flaccidity, drowsiness, or complaints of a headache or sore muscles. FOCAL MOTOR/SENSORY PHENOMENON may precede generalized convulsions but may be tonic or clonic muscle activity that is limited to one extremity, one side of the body, or one side of the face or lateralized/localized sensory sensations. These may only be brief sudden involuntary muscle contractions associated with transitory loss of muscle tone and a brief loss of contact with the environment, repetitive automatic behavior patterns, feelings of familiarity or unfamiliarity associated with compulsive thinking, unpleasant epi- gastric sensations that may radiate to the head, or hallucinations of an auditory, vertiginous, olfactory, gustatory, or visual type.

Erythema Marginatum: an evanescent, erythematous rash characteris- tically (though not commonly) seen in the early stages of rheumatic fever. The rash is not limited to rheumatic fever, however, and has also been reported in patients with allergic drug reactions, sepsis and glomerulonephritis.	WHY:	Although the rash is not pathognomonic of rheumatic fever, its presence is helpful in conjunction with other manifestations of rheumatic fever, particularly carditis with which it is most often associated.	HOW:	The rash is characterized by pink, evanescent, slightly raised small macules with a sharply demarcated and irregular border. The erythematous areas often have pale centers. The rash commonly occurs over the trunk and inner aspects of the upper arms and thighs, but never on the face. It is non-painful and rarely pruritic, may appear and disappear in a matter of hours only to return, and may be brought out by a hot bath or shower. The rash blanches on pressure, and is a transient rash which tends to migrate from place to place.	REFS:	1) Jones criteria (revised) for guidance in the diagnosis of rheumatic fever.

Tender Points Consistent with Fibrositis: localized areas of tenderness elicited by firm digital pressure on specific anatomic sites (see list in HOW section).	WHY:	The presence of typical tender points is a diagnostic sign seen in primary fibromyalgia (fibrositis).	HOW:	Ascertained by physical examination. Since these sites are normally somewhat tender, their location and the amount of pressure necessary to elicit normal degrees of tenderness can be determined on a normal subject (such as the examiner). In the patient being examined, the areas are palpated with digital pressure somewhat less firm, approximately 80% of that which would elicit tenderness in a normal subject. Physical withdrawal, vocalization of tenderness, or facial expression of pain are taken as evidence of exaggerated tenderness. The following list presents many of the consistently characteristic areas of tenderness noted in fibrositis, but is not exhaustive. Tender points on each side are counted individually: i.e., both trapezius muscles being tender counts as two tender points. 1) Insertion of nuchal muscles into occiput 2) Trapezius (R & L). The midpoint of the upper border of the trapezius in the firmer part of the muscle. 3) Second costochondral junction (R & L). On or just lateral to the junction, more marked on the superior surface than elsewhere on the rib. 4) Lateral epicondyle (R & L). Along the insertion of the finger extensor muscles, 1-2 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle. Best located by palpation of the area while the third finger is extended and relaxed. The medial epicondyle (R & L) may also be tender. 5) Buttocks (R & L). The mid-portion of the upper outer quadrant, in the anterior portion of the gluteus medius muscle. 6) Greater trochanter of the hip (R & L). The examiner must exclude trochanteric bursitis. 7) Medial fat pad of the knee (R & L).

Digital scars are stellate shaped scars of old ulcers also located at the tips of the fingers.	WHY:	These digital ulcers and scars occur in scleroderma.	HOW:	The ulcers are 5 to 10 mm in diameter and usually involve the finger- tips. The ulcers appear as shallow pits with sloped edges. They have a bland appearance, in contrast to the punched out or dark, necrotic lesions of the digits seen in polyarteritis. These benign appearing ulcers are painful, heal slowly, and tend to be recurrent. They are often adjacent to star-shaped scars which represent old healed ulcers.

HOW:	Phalen's maneuver is performed by having the patient hold the forearms vertically and then let both hands drop into complete flexion at the wrist for thirty to sixty seconds. The test is positive when numbness and paresthesia in the median-nerve distribution in the hand (i.e., thumb, index finger, middle finger, and lateral half of the palm) are produced or exaggerated.

WHY:	The presence of gonococcal skin lesions in a patient with arthritis is highly suggestive of gonococcal arthritis.	HOW:	Two types of mature skin lesions are consistently seen in gonococcal bacteremia. One is a hemorrhagic (purpuric) papule. The other is a vesicopustular lesion on an erythematous base. Both lesions begin as pinpoint erythematous macules, and typically appear during the first day of symptoms in association with a febrile episode. The purpuric lesions do not blanch with local pressure and often are found on the palms and the soles. They last about a week gradually fading from a dark blue color to a dark brown and then a light brownish yellow color. The vesicopustular lesions evolve through papular, vesicular and pustular stages reaching a maximum diameter of about 2.5 cm. All these stages may be present at the same time. The mature lesion is elevated, slightly umbilicated and surrounded by an erythematous areola. It usually involutes after 4-5 days. The lesions are usually tender and are located on the distal parts of the extremities. The trunk of the body is generally not involved with either lesion. In some cases the purpuric element predominates, while in others the pustular predominates. Rarely, a third variant, a hemorrhagic bulla, will be the sole skin manifestation of gonococcal bacteremia.

Iridocyclitis: the inflammation of the anterior uveal tract, which is composed of the iris and the ciliary body	WHY:	Iridocyclitis may be one of the signs of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (especially of pauciarticular onset), ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, or sarcoidosis.	HOW:	Iridocyclitis may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. In the asymptomatic form, which is usually seen in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, the onset is insidious and the physical findings minimal initially. A slit lamp examination is often required at this time and will show clumps of white blood cells in the anterior chamber and small white precipitates with or without flecks of fibrin on the posterior surface of the cornea. The patient may develop an irregular pupil if adhesions develop between the iris and the capsule of the lens. Later on, cataracts, glaucoma, band keratopathy or phthisis bulbi may develop (see sequelae of iridocyclitis). The symptomatic form usually presents acutely with eye pain, photophobia, or blurred vision. The pupil is small and responds poorly to light. There is a circumcorneal flush secondary to dilated limbal vessels. All the findings seen in asymptomatic iridocyclitis may be found with slit lamp examination.

Murmur of Mitral Insufficiency: an apical systolic murmur caused by the flow of blood from the left ventricle through a damaged mitral valve into the left atrium during systole.	WHY:	The murmur of mitral regurgitation is the most common sign of carditis seen with rheumatic fever.	HOW:	The murmur of mitral insufficiency is a loud, high pitched, blowing murmur filling most of systole. It is heard best in the apical region and is transmitted to the left axilla. It is heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope pressed firmly against the chest. Unlike the innocent functional systolic murmur with which it is most confused, the murmur of mitral insufficiency does not change with changes in the patient's position or phases of respiration. Occasionally, an apical mid-diastolic murmur is also present with the systolic murmur of mitral insufficiency. The mid-diastolic murmur is low pitched, begins immediately after the third heart sound and ends before the first heart sound. It is transient and easily missed, but its presence in association with the systolic murmur makes the diagnosis of rheumatic carditis more likely.

WHY:	Sydenham's chorea is seen in rheumatic fever. The chorea may be associated with other rheumatic manifestations or it may present as the sole expression of rheumatic fever.	HOW:	Typically, the onset of chorea is gradual, with irritability, uncooperativeness, fits of anger, crying, and inappropriate behavior present before the choreiform movements are noted. The movements are rapid and jerky, unlike the slower, rhythmic motion seen in athetosis. Characteristically, on raising his arms above the head, the patient turns the arms so as to oppose the backs of the hands. The patient is unable to sustain a tetanic muscular contraction. On squeezing an examiner's hand the patient can only provide a repetitive, spasmodic grip which is overly pronated and is similar to the motion of milking a cow (milk-maid's grip). The patient's facial expression alternates between frowning, grinning and grimacing. His tongue darts in and out of his mouth. His speech is slurred and vacillates between a halting and an explosive rhythm. The deep tendon reflexes tend to be pendular, i.e., when the knee jerk is elicited with the patient sitting, the leg swings back and forth four or five times like a pendulum, rather than one or two times as in a normal person. Chorea is most common prior to puberty, and in females. It is occasionally seen in adult women but never in adult men.

C0242381|A0431414|AT13936447||AIR|WHAT: Lyme arthritis.	Lyme Arthritis: a viral arthritis characterized by a preceding characteristic rash, erythema chronicum migrans, and typically brief recurrent episodes of asymmetric, pauciarticular swelling and pain primarily involving the larger joints, particularly the knee. The disease is named because of a close geographic clustering of cases seen in Lyme, Connecticut in 1975.	WHY:	Lyme arthritis can sometimes be confused with rheumatic fever or with pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and thus must be excluded when diagnosing the two latter diseases.	HOW:	Lyme arthritis is typically brief (one week) but recurrent. The large joints are usually involved, particularly the knee. When the knee is involved it is usually more swollen than painful. As noted, the distribution of the arthritis tends to be asymmetrical. A rash (erythema chronicum migrans) precedes the development of arthritis, in contrast to the rash (erythema marginatum) seen in rheumatic fever, which accompanies the arthritis of rheumatic fever. Erythema chroni- cum migrans begins as a red macule or papule near the trunk and expands with central clearing to a diameter of up to 50 centimeters. Lyme arthritis is distinguished from pauciarticular JRA by the absence of the iridocyclitis or antinuclear antibodies seen in JRA. Finally, the seasonal onset (peak onset is summer and early fall) and geographic location (most cases seen in Cape Cod, Connecticut or Rhode Island areas) help distinguish this disease.

Tinel's Sign: a clinical test in which percussion of the median nerve at the volar aspect of the wrist produces a tingling sensation in the fingers supplied by the median nerve.	WHY:	The test helps in diagnosing those patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.	HOW:	The test is performed by lightly percussing the median nerve at the volar aspect of the wrist, just radial to the palmaris longus tendon. The test is considered positive if the patient experiences a tingling sensation in the thumb, index, middle or radial half of the ring finger or in the radial half of the palm.

WHY:	Symmetrical sacroiliitis is a characteristic finding of ankylosing spondylitis, whereas it is less common in Reiter's disease, psoriatic spondylitis, and enteropathic arthritis. In these diseases asymmetric sacroiliitis is not uncommon.	HOW:	Sacroiliitis is diagnosed by radiological findings of the sacroiliac joints. These findings include loss of the normal subchondral plate, indistinctness of the subchondral plate, narrowing or apparent widening of the sacroiliac joint space, subchondral sclerosis on both the iliac and sacral side of the sacroiliac joint, subchondral erosions of the sacroiliac joint and fusion of the sacroiliac joint.|N||
