################# Configuration File General Documentation

# This is the configuration file for LexGrid based applications.  Each 
# option in this file is described just before the option.  Any line that 
# starts with a '#' sign is treated as a comment, and is completely ignored 
# by the application.  Due to the way that this file is processed - whenever
# you want to create a '\' character, you need to use two '\'.   For example
# the following paths are valid:
# C:\\temp\\foo\\
# C:/temp/foo/
#
# This path is _NOT_ valid.
# C:\temp\foo

################ Locating the config file at runtime

# The LexGrid system attempts to automatically locate this file in one of two ways:
#
# OPTION 1 - AutoSearch
# It determines the folder that the LexGrid classes are located (either in 
# a jar file, or a folder containing class files).  For this example, lets assume
# that the jar file containing LexGrid was found at 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\lib\lbRuntime.jar'
# Then the path it starts with will be 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\lib\'.  Lets call this 
# location 'A'.  Starting from location A, it checks for the following sub-path: 
# 'resources\config\config.props'.  Lets call this path 'B'.  If a file exists 
# 'A\B', the search is over.  If this file is not found - it goes up one directory
# from A, and checks for B again.  So, now it is checking "A\..\B". - which is
# 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\resources\config\config.props'.  This process continues until 
# it finds the file, reaches the root of the file system, or it has gone up 10 levels.
# At that point, it quits and and the startup fails.
#
# OPTION 2 - System Variable
# You may skip the auto search by setting the System Config variable 'LG_CONFIG_FILE'
# to the full absolute path of the config.props file.  
# Example - if you were starting from the command line, you would add this parameter to 
# the java command to set the 'System Property' 
# -DLG_CONFIG_FILE="C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\resources\config\config.props"

############# Additional Path Configuration

# The LG_BASE_PATH variable is the location that will be used beginning for resolving 
# any relative paths in this configuration file.  
#
# This variable is optional, and should usually be left blank.
#
# If you do not set this variable it will automatically be set to the location of the
# folder that contains your config.props file - this file - when the system starts up.  
# So all of your other relative paths should be set relative to the folder that contains
# your config.props file.  This is the recommended deployment configuration.
#
# Alternatively, you can enter an absolute path here, or you can also set this variable 
# by setting the 'System Property' 'LG_BASE_PATH'.  If you set the System Property variable
# this overrides any value here. 
LG_BASE_PATH=@lexgridbasepath@

# The location of the folder that contains your SQL drivers and extensions.  This folder and 
# its subfolders will be scanned for .jar files to add to the classpath.
#
# This folder must also contain either the lbRuntime.jar file, or the lgUtility.jar file (from
# the runtime-components folder)
#
# This path can be relative to the location of LG_BASE_PATH or absolute.
# You may put more than one folder here by seperating the folders with a ';'.
JAR_FILE_LOCATION=@lexgridjarfilelocation@

# The location of the file that will store information about
# all loaded terminologies.  
# This path can be relative to the location of LG_BASE_PATH or absolute.
REGISTRY_FILE=@lexgridregistryfile@

# The folder that will hold all of the generated system indexes.  
# This path can be relative to the location of LG_BASE_PATH or absolute.
INDEX_LOCATION=@lexgridindexlocation@

############# LexGrid System performance variables

# The maximum number of SQL connections to open (and pool) per database. 
MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_DB=@lexgridmaxconnectionsperdb@

# Size of the Dynamic Cache (this is used to cache frequently accessed information)
CACHE_SIZE=@lexgridcachesize@

# Length of idle time before invalidating Iterators (in minutes)
ITERATOR_IDLE_TIME=@lexgriditeratoridletime@

# Max number of results that can be returned at once by
# any query operation.  This corresponds to the maximum size
# of the lists that are returned by Resolve calls.
#
# NOTE: This does not affect the total number of results
# that can be returned by an iterator, just the size that
# can be returned per 'next' call.
MAX_RESULT_SIZE=@lexgridmaxresultsize@

############# Database Configuration

# When SINGLE_DB_MODE is set to false, a new database will be created 
# for each loaded terminology.  When SINGLE_DB_MODE is set to true, 
# a new set of tables (with a unique prefix) will be created for 
# each loaded terminology.  All terminologies will be held inside 
# the same physical database.
#
# NOTE: This value should typically not be changed once content has
# been loaded.  If a change is required, it is recommended that all
# coding schemes be removed and the resource registry (xml file in
# the same directory as this config) be deleted prior to the change.
SINGLE_DB_MODE=@lexgridsingledbmode@

# This is the address of the database server that will be used
# when you load a new terminology through the LexBIG API.  
#
######  READ THE NEXT LINES CAREFULLY!  ######
# If you have set 'SINGLE_DB_MODE' to 'true', then this variable 
# _should_ contain the database name.
#
# If you have set 'SINGLE_DB_MODE' to 'false', then this variable 
# _should NOT_ contain the database name. Instead, it should end 
# at the end of the server address plus whatever character seperates 
# the server name from the database name. 
#
# NOTE: Changes to the URL will only affect newly loaded content.
# The URL's for content that is already loaded are stored in the 
# registry.xml file.

# Examples for 'SINGLE_DB_MODE=false'

# The prefix to use on created tables or database names.  
# If 'SINGLE_DB_MODE=true', this prefix will be used on the created tables.
# If 'SINGLE_DB_MODE=false', this prefix will be used on the created databases.
#
# WARNING - If you are using Oracle, this is not supported (because of length 
# constraints on oracle table names.)  You must leave this value blank.
# On databases other than Oracle, there should be room for a reasonable (< 10)
# amount of characters.
#
# NOTE: This value MUST BE UNIQUE for each LexBIG runtime
# that utilizes the same database host.
# NOTE: Do not use dashes '-' in the db_prefix value.
# Recommended characters are alphanumeric (a-z, 0-9) and
# underscore '_'.
# NOTE: This variable should typically not be changed after content has been loaded.
DB_PREFIX=@lexgriddbprefix@

# Optional parameters to append to the end of the database
# connection string.  Access to some database environments

# NOTE: Changes to this variable will only affect newly loaded content.  It will
# not be applied to content that has already been loaded.

############# Logging Configuration

# Location of the log files. This path can be relative to the location of LG_BASE_PATH 
# or absolute.  This name should be a directory, which will be created if not present.
LOG_FILE_LOCATION=@lexgridlogfilelocation@

#API Call Logging - enabling API call logging will cause every method call to be printed
#to the log file.
API_LOG_ENABLED=@lexgridapilogenabled@

# Enabling Debug will cause much more information to be
# written to the log files, but will impact runtime performance.
DEBUG_ENABLED=@lexgriddebugenabled@


# Indicates when a new log file should be started.
# This can be a one of the following:
# - A string indicating the rollover time period ('daily', 'weekly',
#   or 'monthly').
# - A number such as '10', which will be read as change log files 
#   after the file size reaches 10 MB.
LOG_CHANGE=@lexgridlogchange@

# Controls automated cleanup of log files.
# If 'LOG_CHANGE' is set to 'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly', this
# variable instructs the service to remove log files that have not
# been written to in X days (note: the unit is treated as days
# regardless of the LOG_CHANGE value.  In this case, cleanup will
# only occur on restart of the JVM.

# If 'LOG_CHANGE' is set to a number, this is the number of old
# log files that will be kept.
