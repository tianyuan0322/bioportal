Implementation of the meta-kb object managers, based on the Protege-OWL kb back-end.
Actual data transactions with the metadata kb are handled through Data Access Objects,
in the package {@link org.ncbo.stanford.manager.metakb.protege.DAO}.  Classes in this
package add a layer of additional functionality to implement the manager interfaces.
<p>
Implementation of a new manager interface will involve many of these steps:
<ul>
  <li>
If there are new object types to be stored in the metadata kb, their classes and properties
will need to be added to the kb definition.  Currently this is an OWL file called 
BioPortalMetadata_v#.#.#.owl.  
  </li>
  <li>
The new object type will need a corresponding java bean, for example see those in package
{@link org.ncbo.stanford.bean}.  The java bean must be a subclass of
{@link org.ncbo.stanford.bean.AbstractIdBean}, as this DAO objects use the ID to retrieve
the individuals from the metadata KB.  If the object should be timestamped in the KB, create
a subclass of {@link org.ncbo.stanford.bean.TimedIdBean} instead, and the base DAO class
will take care of setting the timestamps correctly.
  </li>
  <li>
A manager implementation typically will have one or more DAOs as data members, used for 
saving or retrieving the different object types to or from the KB.
  </li>
  <li>
The class {@link SimpleObjectManagerImpl} implements basic CRUD operations, useful as a 
starting place for a manager implementation.
  </li>
</ul>
