A collection of Data Access Objects (DAOs) used to transfer data to and from the
metadata KB.  Implementations, one for each type of object, are put directly in 
this package.  Base functionality that is the foundation for the DAO implementations
is in package {@link org.ncbo.stanford.manager.metakb.protege.DAO.base}.
<p>
DAO implementations should all be subclasses of {@link base.AbstractDAO}.
